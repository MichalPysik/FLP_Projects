All tests were run in the following manner: ./flp22-fun -b -o test/testxx.in > test/testxx.out

filename - optimal solution - description
test01.in - [0 1 0 0] - taken from project instructions
test02.in - False - unpossible to satify minCost
test03.in - [0 0 0 0] - only way to satisfy maxWeight is an empty knapsack
test04.in - [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0] - slightly more complicated problem
